# EncyEmail

"EncyEmail" project is based on the idea of creating a website where it has the two features:
1. Consult the definitions, i.e. informative and critical voices;
2. Send emails, entering their email, to users.

Before starting it, make sure you have the latest version of Python installed and you need to install the *requirements* and you write like this from the terminal:

```pip install -r requirements.txt ```


If you have installed the requirements, now you can start the project by writing like this from the terminal:

```python app.py```

Good fun!!
